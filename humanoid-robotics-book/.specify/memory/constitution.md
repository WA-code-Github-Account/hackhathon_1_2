# Project Constitution: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This document outlines the guiding principles for the creation of the textbook.

## 1. Target Audience
- **Primary:** University students (undergraduate) and self-learners.
- **Prerequisites:** Assumes readers have a basic understanding of programming (preferably Python) but are new to the fields of AI and robotics.

## 2. Tone of Voice
- **Clarity:** The language will be clear, concise, and easy to understand.
- **Educational:** The primary goal is to educate. Complex topics will be broken down into simple, digestible parts.
- **Engaging:** The content will be made engaging through practical examples, and real-world scenarios. We will avoid overly academic or dry language.

## 3. Technical Depth
- **Foundational Concepts:** The book will focus on the foundational concepts of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
- **Practical Application:** Theoretical concepts will be supported by practical, runnable code examples to reinforce learning.

## 4. Code Examples
- **Language:** All code examples will be written in Python.
- **Standard:** Code will adhere to the PEP 8 style guide.
- **Clarity:** Examples will be well-commented and structured for maximum readability and understanding.

## 5. Core Technologies
- **Book Platform:** The textbook will be built and published using Docusaurus.
- **Chatbot Backend:** The RAG chatbot will be powered by a FastAPI backend.
- **Data & Search:** The chatbot will utilize a Neon Serverless Postgres database for data storage and a Qdrant Cloud vector database for semantic search.
