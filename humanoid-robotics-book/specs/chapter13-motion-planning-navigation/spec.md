2.  **Given** a reader evaluating robot ROI, **When** they read Section 13.1, **Then** they can identify the benefits of using humanoids for repetitive or physically demanding tasks.

### User Story 2 - Explore Roles in Healthcare and Assisted Living (Priority: P1)

The reader wants to understand the present and future roles of humanoid robots in healthcare settings and for assisting individuals in daily life.

**Why this priority**: Addresses the social and care-giving aspects, which are often central to the development of human-like robots.

**Independent Test**: The reader can describe how humanoids can contribute to healthcare and provide assistance in daily living.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a reader interested in assistive technology, **When** they read Section 13.2, **Then** they can understand how humanoids can support medical professionals or aid the elderly.
2.  **Given** a reader considering ethical implications, **When** they read Section 13.2, **Then** they can identify the sensitive contexts of robot caregiving.

### User Story 3 - Investigate Use in Disaster Response and Exploration (Priority: P2)

The reader wants to learn how humanoid robots are uniquely suited for dangerous tasks such as disaster response and exploration in hazardous environments.

**Why this priority**: Showcases the ability of humanoids to operate in environments too risky for humans, leveraging their human-like form to navigate challenging terrains.

**Independent Test**: The reader can explain why humanoids are advantageous for disaster response and exploration tasks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a reader interested in extreme applications, **When** they read Section 13.3, **Then** they can understand how humanoids can access and operate in environments designed for humans but too dangerous for them.
2.  **Given** a reader evaluating robot capabilities, **When** they read Section 13.3, **Then** they can identify the specific advantages of human-like mobility and manipulation in search and rescue.
