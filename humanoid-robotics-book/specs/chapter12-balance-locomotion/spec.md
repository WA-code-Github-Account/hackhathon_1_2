## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Understand the Importance of Socially Aware Robots (Priority: P1)

The reader wants to grasp why robots need to be socially aware, especially when interacting with humans in shared environments.

**Why this priority**: Highlights the necessity of designing robots that can seamlessly integrate into human society and understand social cues.

**Independent Test**: The reader can explain why social awareness is critical for robots operating alongside humans.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a reader interested in robot integration, **When** they read Section 12.1, **Then** they can identify the benefits of robots understanding human social norms.
2.  **Given** a reader considering future robot applications, **When** they read Section 12.1, **Then** they can understand the implications of robots lacking social awareness.

### User Story 2 - Learn about Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication (Priority: P1)

The reader wants to understand how robots communicate with humans, encompassing both spoken language and physical gestures or expressions.

**Why this priority**: Covers the primary modalities through which robots exchange information and intent with humans.

**Independent Test**: The reader can describe different forms of communication (verbal, non-verbal) that robots can employ with humans.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a reader observing human-robot interaction, **When** they read Section 12.2, **Then** they can recognize and analyze the communication channels used.
2.  **Given** a reader designing robot communication, **When** they read Section 12.2, **Then** they can identify strategies for effective verbal and non-verbal robot communication.

### User Story 3 - Grasp Understanding Human Intent and Predicting Actions (Priority: P2)

The reader wants to learn how robots can infer human intentions and anticipate their next actions, which is vital for safe and efficient collaboration.

**Why this priority**: Addresses the advanced cognitive capabilities required for truly collaborative and proactive human-robot systems.

**Independent Test**: The reader can explain why understanding human intent is important for robots and how they might predict human actions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a reader interested in collaborative robots, **When** they read Section 12.3, **Then** they can understand how robots can anticipate what a human partner will do next.
2.  **Given** a reader studying robot autonomy, **When** they read Section 12.3, **Then** they can identify the challenges and approaches to modeling human behavior for robot interaction.
