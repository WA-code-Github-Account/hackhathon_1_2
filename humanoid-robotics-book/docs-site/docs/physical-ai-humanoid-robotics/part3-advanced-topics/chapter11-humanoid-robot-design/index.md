# Chapter 11: Manipulation: Grasping and Dexterity

This chapter explores the complexities of robotic manipulation, focusing on how humanoid robots grasp objects and perform dexterous tasks in the physical world.

## 11.1 The Challenge of Robot Grasping

This section will delve into the inherent difficulties involved in enabling robots to reliably grasp a wide variety of objects. We will discuss factors such as object geometry, material properties, and environmental uncertainty that make grasping a complex problem.

## 11.2 Types of Grippers and Robotic Hands

We will examine the diverse range of end-effectors used for robotic manipulation. This includes an overview of simple grippers and more advanced, multi-fingered robotic hands, highlighting their design principles and suitability for different tasks requiring varying levels of dexterity.

## 11.3 Grasp Planning and Force Control

This section introduces the algorithmic aspects of grasp planning, where robots determine the optimal way to approach and secure an object. We will also cover the importance of force control, which allows robots to exert precise forces during manipulation, crucial for handling delicate objects or interacting with unknown environments.
