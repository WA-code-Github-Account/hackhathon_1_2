# Chapter 5: Machine Learning for Robotics: An Overview

This chapter provides a foundational overview of how machine learning techniques are applied in the field of robotics, highlighting key paradigms and practical considerations.

## 5.1 Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning

This section will introduce the three primary types of machine learning: supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through interaction and rewards), explaining their relevance and application to robotic tasks.

## 5.2 Common Challenges: Data Scarcity and the Sim-to-Real Gap

We will discuss prevalent challenges encountered when applying machine learning to physical robots. This includes the issue of data scarcity (difficulty in collecting large datasets from real robots) and the "sim-to-real gap" (discrepancies when transferring models trained in simulation to real-world deployment).

## 5.3 Building a Simple Classifier for Sensor Data (Code Example)

To illustrate practical application, this section will present a basic code example. This example will demonstrate how a simple machine learning classifier can be built and used to interpret or categorize data acquired from a robot's sensors, providing a hands-on introduction to ML in robotics.
