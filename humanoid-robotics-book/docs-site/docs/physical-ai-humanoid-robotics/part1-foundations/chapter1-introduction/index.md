# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of Physical AI, exploring its definition, the transition from virtual to physical intelligence, and a brief history of how AI and robotics have converged.

## 1.1 What is Physical AI?

This section will define Physical AI as the intersection of artificial intelligence with physical embodiment. It will explain how Physical AI enables robots to perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world in a goal-oriented manner, distinguishing it from purely software-based AI.

## 1.2 The Shift from Virtual Assistants to Physical Agents

We will explore the evolution of AI from disembodied virtual assistants to embodied physical agents. This section will discuss the motivations and challenges behind this shift, emphasizing the unique advantages and complexities that arise when AI systems operate in the real world.

## 1.3 Core Concepts of Embodied Intelligence

This section will delve into the fundamental principles of embodied intelligence. Key concepts such as the importance of perception-action loops, situatedness, and how intelligence can emerge from the interaction between a body and its environment will be introduced.

## 1.4 A Brief History of AI and Robotics Convergence

This section provides a historical overview of how the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, once distinct, have progressively converged. We will highlight key milestones and developments that have led to the current era of Physical AI and the rise of humanoid robotics.
