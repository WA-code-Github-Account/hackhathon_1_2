# Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Robotics: Kinematics and Dynamics

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of kinematics and dynamics, essential for understanding how robots move and interact with their environment.

## 2.1 Degrees of Freedom and Configuration Space

This section will define degrees of freedom (DoF) and explain how they describe the number of independent parameters required to uniquely specify a robot's configuration. It will also introduce the concept of configuration space, a mathematical representation of all possible robot poses.

## 2.2 Forward vs. Inverse Kinematics

Here, we differentiate between forward and inverse kinematics. Forward kinematics involves calculating the end-effector's position and orientation given the joint angles, while inverse kinematics solves for the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector pose.

## 2.3 Introduction to Robot Dynamics: Forces and Torques

This section provides an overview of robot dynamics, focusing on the forces and torques that cause or influence robot motion. We will discuss basic principles of rigid body dynamics as applied to robotic manipulators.

## 2.4 Simulating a Simple Robotic Arm (Code Example)

To bring the theoretical concepts to life, this section will present a simple code example demonstrating the simulation of a robotic arm. This example will illustrate how kinematic principles can be applied in a practical context.
