# Chapter 4: Actuators and Control Systems

This chapter explores the mechanisms that enable robot movement and the foundational principles used to control them precisely.

## 4.1 Types of Robot Actuators (e.g., Electric Motors)

This section will introduce various types of actuators, the "muscles" of a robot. We will cover their operating principles, advantages, and disadvantages, focusing on electric motors as a primary example in humanoid robotics.

## 4.2 Open-Loop vs. Closed-Loop Control

We will differentiate between open-loop and closed-loop control systems. Open-loop systems execute commands without feedback, while closed-loop systems use sensor data to continuously adjust their actions, enabling more precise and robust control.

## 4.3 PID Controllers: The Workhorse of Robotics

This section will delve into PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers, a widely used feedback control mechanism in robotics. We will explain the role of each component (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) in minimizing errors and achieving desired system behavior.

## 4.4 Implementing a PID Controller (Code Example)

To provide practical insight, this section will include a simple code example demonstrating the implementation of a PID controller. This will illustrate how the theoretical concepts translate into a functional control system for a robotic element.
