# Chapter 3: Sensors and Perception for Robots

This chapter delves into the critical role of sensors and perception in enabling robots to understand and interact with the physical world.

## 3.1 The Role of Perception in Physical AI

This section will discuss why perception is fundamental for physical AI, enabling robots to gather information from their environment, build internal representations, and make informed decisions for autonomous operation.

## 3.2 Common Robot Sensors (Cameras, LiDAR, IMUs)

We will explore various types of sensors commonly used in robotics, including cameras for visual information, LiDAR for precise distance measurements and 3D mapping, and IMUs for tracking orientation and movement. Their principles of operation and typical applications will be covered.

## 3.3 Sensor Fusion: Creating a Coherent World Model

This section focuses on sensor fusion, the process of combining data from multiple disparate sensors to achieve a more accurate, complete, and robust understanding of the robot's surroundings than any single sensor could provide alone.

## 3.4 Introduction to Processing Sensor Data (e.g., Point Clouds)

We will introduce basic concepts and techniques for processing raw sensor data. This includes an overview of how data from sensors like LiDAR is transformed into usable formats, such as point clouds, for further analysis and decision-making by the robot.
