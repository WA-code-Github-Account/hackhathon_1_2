# Chapter 8: Planning and Navigation Algorithms (SLAM)

This chapter introduces the fundamental algorithms that allow robots to intelligently plan their movements and understand their environment, focusing on path planning and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).

## 8.1 Path Planning Algorithms (e.g., A*, Dijkstra)

This section will cover key algorithms used for generating efficient and collision-free paths for robots. We will explore the principles behind algorithms like A* and Dijkstra's, demonstrating how they enable a robot to navigate from a starting point to a destination in a known environment.

## 8.2 Introduction to SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

We will delve into Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), a critical capability for autonomous robots operating in unknown environments. This section will explain the "chicken-and-egg" problem of SLAM and how robots concurrently build maps of their surroundings while tracking their own position within those maps.

## 8.3 Implementing A* for a 2D Grid World (Code Example)

To provide a practical understanding, this section will include a simple code example demonstrating the implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm in a 2D grid-based environment. This will allow readers to see how path planning concepts translate into executable code.
