# Chapter 6: Computer Vision for Object Recognition and Tracking

This chapter explores the foundational and advanced techniques of computer vision, focusing on how robots perceive and interpret their visual environment for object recognition and tracking.

## 6.1 Classical vs. Deep Learning Approaches to Computer Vision

This section will compare traditional computer vision methods, which often rely on hand-crafted features and explicit algorithms, with modern deep learning approaches that leverage large neural networks for automated feature extraction and pattern recognition.

## 6.2 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Object Detection

We will delve into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specific type of neural network that has revolutionized computer vision. This section will explain their architecture and how they are effectively used for tasks like object detection, where the goal is to identify and locate multiple objects within an image.

## 6.3 Using a Pre-trained Model for Object Detection (Code Example)

To provide a practical application, this section will offer a code example demonstrating how to utilize a pre-trained deep learning model for object detection. This will allow readers to quickly implement powerful computer vision capabilities without the need for extensive training data or computational resources.
