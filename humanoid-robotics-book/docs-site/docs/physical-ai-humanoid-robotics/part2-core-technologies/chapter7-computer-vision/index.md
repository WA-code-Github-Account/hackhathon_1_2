# Chapter 7: Reinforcement Learning for Robot Control

This chapter introduces Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a powerful paradigm for enabling robots to learn optimal behaviors through interaction with their environment.

## 7.1 The RL Framework: Agents, Environments, and Rewards

This section will establish the fundamental components of any RL system: the agent (the robot), the environment (the world it interacts with), and the reward signal (feedback guiding its learning process). We will explain how these elements combine to form a learning loop.

## 7.2 Value-based vs. Policy-based Methods (e.g., Q-Learning, PPO)

We will explore the two main categories of RL algorithms. Value-based methods focus on learning the "value" of states or actions, while policy-based methods directly learn a mapping from states to actions. Examples like Q-Learning and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) will be briefly introduced.

## 7.3 Training a Robot in a Simulator (Code Example)

This section will provide a practical demonstration of training a robot using RL within a simulated environment. A simple code example will illustrate the process of defining an RL problem, setting up a simulator, and observing an agent learn to perform a task.
