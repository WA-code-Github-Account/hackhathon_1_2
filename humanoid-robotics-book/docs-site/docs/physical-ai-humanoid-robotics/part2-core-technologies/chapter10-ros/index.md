# Chapter 10: Bipedal Locomotion: Walking and Balancing

This chapter explores the intricate challenges and solutions involved in enabling humanoid robots to walk and maintain balance on two legs, mirroring human locomotion.

## 10.1 The Complexity of Human Walking

This section will analyze the biomechanical sophistication of human walking, highlighting why it is a remarkably efficient yet complex process. Understanding these natural mechanisms provides a foundation for designing effective bipedal locomotion in robots.

## 10.2 The Zero Moment Point (ZMP) for Stable Walking

We will introduce the crucial concept of the Zero Moment Point (ZMP), a key stability criterion in bipedal robotics. This section will explain how maintaining the ZMP within the robot's support polygon is essential for achieving stable standing and walking.

## 10.3 Dynamic Balancing and Disturbance Rejection

This section delves into how humanoid robots maintain dynamic balance, not just statically, but while moving and subjected to external forces. We will discuss various strategies for actively counteracting disturbances and ensuring the robot remains upright during locomotion.
