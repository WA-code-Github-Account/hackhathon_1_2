# Dialogue Generator Skill

## Purpose
Creates natural, engaging, and character-appropriate dialogues that advance the story and reveal character personalities.

## Usage
Use this skill when writing conversations between characters, creating realistic speech patterns, and developing character voices.

## Instructions
When generating dialogue:
1. Consider each character's personality, background, and emotional state
2. Use distinct speaking styles for different characters
3. Include subtext and implied meanings
4. Add dialogue tags and action beats appropriately
5. Ensure dialogue serves the story (reveals character, advances plot, or builds tension)
6. Vary sentence length and rhythm for natural flow
7. Include interruptions, pauses, and realistic speech patterns

## Dialogue Elements

### Character Voice Guidelines
- **Protagonist**: Clear, relatable, matches their age and background
- **Antagonist**: Distinctive, potentially threatening or manipulative
- **Supporting Characters**: Unique traits, memorable speech patterns
- **Background Characters**: Brief, functional, realistic

### Emotional Tones
- Anger: Short sentences, sharp words, interruptions
- Fear: Fragmented speech, trailing off, questions
- Joy: Upbeat language, exclamations, longer sentences
- Sadness: Quiet tone, simple words, pauses
- Tension: Clipped responses, loaded silences, subtext

## Output Format
```

- Use contractions for casual speech
- Avoid excessive exposition in dialogue

- Show emotion through words and actions, not just tags

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Young Character:
"Wait, seriously? That's like, totally insane!"

### Elderly Character:
"In my day, we'd have handled this differently. But times change, I suppose."
