# Plot Consistency Checker

## Purpose
Analyzes the manuscript for plot holes, timeline issues, and consistency errors.

## Usage
Use when reviewing drafts or during the editing phase of your book.

## Instructions
Check for:
1. Timeline inconsistencies (dates, seasons, character ages)
2. Character behavior contradictions
3. Setting description mismatches
4. Plot hole identification
5. Cause-and-effect logic gaps
6. Foreshadowing and payoff alignment

## Checklist Format
```
Timeline Check:
✓ All dates and durations are consistent
✗ Issue: Chapter 5 mentions winter, but Chapter 3 established summer

Character Consistency:
✓ Protagonist's motivations remain clear throughout
✗ Issue: Supporting character's eye color changes (blue in Ch.2, brown in Ch.7)

Plot Logic:
✓ All major questions are answered by the end
✗ Issue: The locked door mystery introduced in Ch.4 is never resolved

Setting Details:
✓ Location descriptions match across chapters
✗ Issue: Town population stated as 5,000 in Ch.1, but 50,000 in Ch.10
```

## Best Practices
- Review the manuscript chapter by chapter
- Create a timeline document as reference
- Track character details in a separate spreadsheet
- Note all introduced mysteries and ensure resolution
- Check travel times and distances for realism
