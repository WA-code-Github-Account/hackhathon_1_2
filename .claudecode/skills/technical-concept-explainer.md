## Robotics & Physical AI Specific Topics

### **Core Concepts to Explain:**
- Kinematics and Dynamics
- Sensor Fusion
- Computer Vision for Robotics
- Path Planning and Navigation
- Machine Learning in Robotics
- Human-Robot Interaction
- Actuators and Control Systems
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Reinforcement Learning for Robots
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Edge AI and Embedded Systems
- Neural Networks for Robotics
- Humanoid Locomotion
- Manipulation and Grasping
- Real-time Processing

## Best Practices
- Always start with "why it matters" before "how it works"
- Use consistent terminology throughout explanations
- Provide multiple perspectives (hardware, software, theoretical)
- Include failure cases and limitations
- Reference industry standards and frameworks (ROS, OpenCV, PyTorch)
- Connect to practical robotics applications
- Use progressive examples (toy robot → industrial robot → humanoid)
- Address safety and ethical considerations where relevant

## Example Analogies for Common Concepts

**Sensor Fusion:**
"Like how your brain combines sight, sound, and touch to understand your surroundings, robots combine data from multiple sensors (cameras, LIDAR, IMU) to build a complete picture of their environment."

**PID Control:**
"Similar to adjusting shower temperature—if it's too cold, you turn it up (proportional), if it's been cold for a while, you turn it up more (integral), and if it's changing rapidly, you adjust carefully (derivative)."

**Neural Networks:**
"Think of it like training a new employee—at first they make mistakes, but with feedback (backpropagation), they gradually learn the patterns and improve their performance."

**SLAM:**
"Imagine exploring a dark room with a flashlight while simultaneously drawing a map. As you move, you're figuring out where you are AND creating a map at the same time."
